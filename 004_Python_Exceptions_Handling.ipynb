    "## Exceptions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that **represents an error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many **[built-in exceptions](https://github.com/milaan9/05_Python_Files/blob/main/003_Python_File_Exception.ipynb)** that are raised when your program encounters an error (something in the program goes wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it **terminates** and **quits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these exceptions occur, the Python interpreter stops the current process and passes it to the calling process until it is handled. If not handled, the program will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us consider a program where we have a function **`A`** that calls **[function](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/blob/main/001_Python_Functions.ipynb)** **`B`**, which in turn calls function **`C`**. If an exception occurs in function **`C`** but is not handled in **`C`**, the exception passes to **`B`** and then to **`A`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If never handled, an error message is displayed and our program comes to a sudden unexpected halt."
